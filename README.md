# Snapchat But Not

This project was conceptualized and assigned to me by my Mobile Software Development professor, Mr. Shuo Niu, at Virginia Tech.

This is Snapchat (or a very dumbed down version of it)! This application allows the user to take a picture or a selfie. Then the user can edit the image by drawing in red, blue, or green over the image, or by placing 2 types of stickers over the image.

# Screen Map and Execution

When the user starts the application, it opens up with a START button (StartScreen.png). The user clicks the START button, and it opens up a camera for the user to take a picture (CameraScreen.png). One the user has taken a picture, he or she should click the check mark at the bottom if he or she is satisfied with the image, or the redo button to take the picture again. Once the user is satisfied, clicking the check mark will take the user to the Edit Screen (EditScreen.png).

On the Edit Screen, the user can draw in three different colors and place two types of stickers. To draw, you simply drag your finger along the image, allowing a colored line to follow. By default, the color of the lines for drawing start off with red. If the user wishes to change the color of the lines, they can press any of the three buttons representing the three colors to change it. If the user wishes to undo something they drew, he or she can press the UNDO button, which will remove the last thing drawn by the user. If the user wishes to clear all the lines in the image, he or she can press the CLEAR button.

If the user wants to add a sticker, he or she can double tap at the spot they wish to add a sticker, and Captain America's shield will pop up at that spot. If the user long presses a spot, then Iron Man's chest piece will appear at the spot. If the user wants to remove a sticker, he or she can shake his or her phone straight downward once to remove the last placed sticker. If the user wants to remove all the stickers, he or she can shake his or her phone side to side once to clear all the stickers.

Once the user is done editing his or her image, she can take a screenshot of the image and save it to his or her phone. The application itself does not save the edited image, so when the user clicks the DONE button, the application returns to the Start Screen, ready for the user to create a new image.

You will need to change the directory names to your name when it's imported because the project was under my directory structure. Also you may need to 'File -> Invalidate Cache / Restart' and 'Build -> Clean Project' in order to rebuild your project. 

Make sure your phone is placed in developer mode and connect it to your computer via USB. Android should register the phone. Then you can press the Run 'app' (Play) button, choose your phone to download the project, and it will install.
